# Artificial-Financial-Market
Visualization of a Toy Financial Market created with agent based modelling using the mesa package in python (https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). 
Highly simplistic toy financial market with heterogenous agents reacting to market news and exhibiting some elements of market contagion. Not a predictive model, the idea was to
see if such a model can capture such features as the boom and bust cycles that traditional forecasting models typically don't exhibit.
The two .csv files are needed to run the model.
